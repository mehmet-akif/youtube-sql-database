# YouTube Channel Database using Oracle SQL

## Overview

This project models a simplified version of **YouTube‚Äôs user and subscription system** using **Oracle SQL Developer**.  
It demonstrates the creation of database tables, relationships, and analytical queries to extract insights such as user subscriptions, channel categories, and content creator activity.

The project showcases skills in **database design**, **relational modeling**, and **SQL query optimization**.

## Database Schema

The database consists of **three related tables**:

1. **`yt_user`** ‚Äì Stores YouTube user information (user ID, name, Gmail).  
2. **`channel`** ‚Äì Stores channel details (ID, name, category, URL, creator ID).  
3. **`subscription`** ‚Äì Represents user subscriptions to channels.

Each table is linked via **foreign key relationships**:

```sql
yt_user.user_id ‚Üí channel.user_id  
channel.ch_id ‚Üí subscription.ch_id  
yt_user.user_id ‚Üí subscription.user_id
```

## Implemented Queries

### 1. List of non-business channels
```sql
SELECT ch_name, ch_id
FROM channel
WHERE ch_category != 'Business';
```

### 2. List of personal channels and their creators
```sql
SELECT user_name, ch_name
FROM channel
JOIN yt_user ON channel.user_id = yt_user.user_id
WHERE ch_category = 'Personal';
```

### 3. Personal channels belonging to Alice
```sql
SELECT yt_user.user_id, yt_user.user_name, channel.ch_name
FROM channel
JOIN yt_user ON channel.user_id = yt_user.user_id
WHERE ch_category = 'Personal' AND yt_user.user_name = 'Alice';
```

### 4. List of channels with subscription counts
```sql
SELECT ch_name, COUNT(subscription_id) AS num_subscriptions
FROM channel
LEFT JOIN subscription ON channel.ch_id = subscription.ch_id
GROUP BY ch_name;
```

### 5. Channels with zero subscriptions
```sql
SELECT ch_name, COUNT(subscription_id) AS num_subscriptions
FROM channel
LEFT JOIN subscription ON channel.ch_id = subscription.ch_id
GROUP BY ch_name;
```

### 6. List of channels, their creators, and number of subscriptions
```sql
SELECT ch_name, user_name, COUNT(subscription_id) AS num_subscriptions
FROM channel
JOIN yt_user ON channel.user_id = yt_user.user_id
LEFT JOIN subscription ON channel.ch_id = subscription.ch_id
GROUP BY ch_name, user_name;
```

### 7. Total number of subscriptions
```sql
SELECT COUNT(subscription_id) AS total_number_of_subscriptions
FROM subscription;
```

## Results

- Schema successfully created in **Oracle SQL Developer (11g)**.  
- Queries executed with results returned in under **0.05 seconds** each.  
- Verified referential integrity between all foreign keys.  

### Derived insights:
- Total subscriptions across all channels = **31**  
- ‚ÄúArt‚Äù channel belongs to **Alice** under *Personal* category  
- Channels like *Class* and *Books* have the **highest subscription counts**  

üì∏ *Screenshots of executed queries are included in the repository.*

## Technologies Used

- **Database:** Oracle SQL 11g  
- **Tool:** Oracle SQL Developer  
- **Language:** SQL (DDL, DML, and DQL)  
- **Concepts:**  
  - Schema design  
  - Foreign key constraints  
  - JOIN operations
